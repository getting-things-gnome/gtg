        "defining  &quot;subtasks&quot;. In GTG, those subtasks are "
        "considered as prerequisites that must be completed before being able"
        " to close their parent task.\n\n"

        "appear as links in the task description, just like the link below. "
        "To open and edit a subtask, simply click on its link! Try it"

        "? Try to close the subtask above for instance!\n"
        "\n"
        "When you close a task, you will notice that all its subtasks will be"
        " automatically closed too! Indeed, GTG considers that if you have"

        " anymore (they were prerequisites, after all).\n"
        "\n"
