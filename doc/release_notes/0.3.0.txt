Getting Things GNOME! 0.3 - Release Note - 06/11/2012
=====================================================

After about 9 months of very active development, the GTG team is proud to
announce the release of Getting Things GNOME! 0.3!

This version is packed with an amazing amount of bug fixes and many novelties!
The goal with 0.3 was to get GTG back on its feet after more than a year of
working on the internal plumbing. We also fixed many bugs in the process. We
can now say that this goal has been reached, and then some!

What's new in 0.3?
------------------

Here's an (incomplete) list of changes:

  - Performance: thanks to the amazing work of Izidor Matusov, GTG has recovered
    its youth and can handle your many tasks way faster than before!
  - Data backup: GTG keeps several copies of your data, and it's now able to 
    restore the most recent backup automatically if your data are corrupted.
  - Help: GTG now has many help pages providing useful documentation for GTG,
    thanks to Radina Matic (our community manager and 2012 intern for the GNOME
    outreach program) [2]
  - UI: we've improved our UI in several ways. The most notable will probably
    be the new tag editor, which provides an easier way to customize and edit
    tag's properties such as colors, icon, etc.
  - Translations: all translations were updated, and we also got new languages
    added to this release!
  - Stability: we've fixed many bugs causing crashes during this release.
  - Various other fixes:
      - Updated and improved plugins: notification area icon, urgency color,
        export, ...
      - Improved Quick Add Toolbar, with more features and flags for you geeks.
      - Improved command line clients
      - Saner handling of due dates constraints.

The GTG developer team would like to thank and congratulate all the great people
which contributed to this version. You did an amazing work! Thanks also to our
many new contributors which joined us during this development cycle!

What's next?
------------

During the next months, we plan to work on the porting of GTG to GTK3. This
should hopefully enable the upcoming redesign of GTG [3]!

We also have many other projects in the pipeline, most notably:

 - collaborative task management, a project which has been started by
   Izidor Matusov during Google Summer of Code 2012 [4].
 - improved task editor, a work performed by Steve Scheel during Google Summer
   of Code 2012 [5].

It's also worth mentioning the great work accomplished by Baptiste Saleil, who
has integrated GTG with GNOME Shell through a GNOME Shell extension (also a
Google Summer of Code 2012) [6].

About Getting Things GNOME!
---------------------------

GTG is a personal task organizer for the GNOME desktop inspired by the Getting
Things Done (GTD) methodology. GTG is designed with flexibility, adaptability,
and ease of use in mind so it can be used as more than just GTD software.

GTG is intended to help you track everything you need to do and need to know,
from small tasks to large projects.
