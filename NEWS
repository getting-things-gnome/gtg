Version 0.4
===========
These are abbreviated release notes.
See https://fortintam.com/blog/gtg-0-4-released for complete release notes.

The much-awaited 0.4 release of Getting Things GNOME (‚ÄúGTG‚Äù) is a major overhaul
that brings together many updates and enhancements, including new features, a
modernized user interface and updated underlying technology (fully ported to
Python 3, GTK 3, and GObject introspection). GTG itself has undergone over 630
changes affecting over 500 files, and received hundreds of bug fixes, as can be
seen on https://launchpad.net/gtg/+milestone/0.4 and
https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/milestones

The UI has been updated to follow the current GNOME HIG and design patterns:
 ‚Ä¢ Client-side window decorations using the GTK HeaderBar widget.
   Along with the removal of the menu bars, this saves a significant amount
   of space and allows for more content to be displayed on screen.
 ‚Ä¢ The Preferences dialog was redesigned, and its contents cleaned up to remove
   obsolete settings (https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/pull/227).
 ‚Ä¢ All windows are properly parented (set as transient) with the main window,
   so that they can be handled better by window managers.
 ‚Ä¢ Symbolic icons are available throughout the UI.
 ‚Ä¢ Improvements to padding and borders are visible throughout the application.

New Features
 ‚Ä¢ You can now open (or create) a task‚Äôs parent task.
 ‚Ä¢ You can now select multiple closed tasks and perform bulk actions on them.
 ‚Ä¢ You can now rename or delete tags by right-clicking them in the main window.
 ‚Ä¢ You can automatically generate and assign tag colors.
 ‚Ä¢ The Quick Add entry now supports emojis ü§©
 ‚Ä¢ The Task Editor now provides a searchable ‚Äútag picker‚Äù widget.
 ‚Ä¢ The ‚ÄúTask Reaper‚Äù allows deleting old closed tasks for increased performance.
   Previously available as a plugin, it is now a built-in feature,
   available in the Preferences dialog.
 ‚Ä¢ The Quick Deferral (previously, the ‚ÄúDo it Tomorrow‚Äù plugin) is now built-in.
   It is now possible to defer multiple tasks at once to common upcoming days
   or to a custom date.
 ‚Ä¢ In the unlikely case where GTG encounters a problem opening your data file,
   it will automatically attempt recovery from a previous backup snapshot
   and let you know about it.

Main window (‚ÄúTask Browser‚Äù) improvements
 ‚Ä¢ The menu bar has been replaced by a menu button.
   Non-contextual actions have been moved to the main menu button.
 ‚Ä¢ Searching is now handled through a dedicated Search Bar
   that can be toggled on and off with the mouse,
   or the Ctrl+F keyboard shortcut.
 ‚Ä¢ The ‚ÄúWorkview‚Äù mode has been renamed to the ‚ÄúActionable‚Äù view.
 ‚Ä¢ Sorting tasks by title is now case-insensitive and ignores @ characters
   https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/issues/375
 ‚Ä¢ Start/Due/Closed dates now display as properly translated in the Task Browser
   https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/issues/357
 ‚Ä¢ In the right-click context menus, more start/due dates choices are available,
   including common upcoming dates and a custom date picker
   https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/issues/244

Task Editor improvements
 ‚Ä¢ The Calendar date picker pop-up widgets have been improved
   https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/pull/230
 ‚Ä¢ The Task Editor now tries to place newly created windows more logically
   https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/issues/287
 ‚Ä¢ The title (first line of a task) has been changed to a neutral black header,
   so that it doesn‚Äôt look like a hyperlink.

Documentation Updates
 ‚Ä¢ The user manual has been rewritten, reorganized, and updated with new images
   https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/issues/243
 ‚Ä¢ Contributor documentation was rewritten to make it easier to get involved
   and to clarify project contribution guidelines.

Backend and Code Quality improvements
 ‚Ä¢ Updates were made to overall code quality to reduce barriers to contribution
   https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/issues/237
 ‚Ä¢ The code has been ported to use GtkApplication,
   resulting in simpler and more robust UI code overall.
 ‚Ä¢ GtkBuilder/Glade ‚Äú.ui‚Äù files have been regrouped into one location.
 ‚Ä¢ Reorganization of various .py files for consistency.
 ‚Ä¢ The debugging/logging system has been simplified.
 ‚Ä¢ Various improvements to the test suite.
 ‚Ä¢ The codebase is mostly PEP8-compliant.
 ‚Ä¢ We relaxed the PEP8 max line length convention to 100 cols for readability,
   because this is not the nineties anymore.
 ‚Ä¢ Support is available for Tox, for testing automation within virtualenvs
 ‚Ä¢ The application‚Äôs translatable strings have been reviewed and harmonized,
   to ensure the entire application is translatable.
 ‚Ä¢ Application CSS has been moved to its own file
   https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/pull/229
 ‚Ä¢ GTG now provides an ‚ÄúAppData‚Äù (FreeDesktop AppStream metadata) file
   to properly present itself in distro-agnostic software-centers.
 ‚Ä¢ The Meson build system is now supported
   https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/pull/315
     ‚Ä¢ The development version‚Äôs launch script now allows running
       with various languages, using the LANG environment variable for example.
     ‚Ä¢ Appdata and desktop files are named based on the chosen Meson profile
       https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/pull/349
     ‚Ä¢ Depending on the Meson profile, the HeaderBar style changes dynamically
       to indicate when run in a dev environment, such as GNOME Builder
       https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/issues/341

In order to bring this release out of the door, some plugins (and all
synch services) have been disabled and are awaiting adoption by new
contributors to test and maintain them.
See https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/issues/222
Please contribute to maintain your favorite plugin. Likewise, we had to remove
the DBus module (and would welcome help to bring it back into a better shape,
for those who want to control the app via DBus).

They predate this file, and documenting them here is a questionable endeavor.
