Testing
-------

You can run the unit tests for GTG with::

  make check

You can also manually test your changes with debugging data with::

  ./scripts/debug.sh

Using ``debug.sh`` will prevent GTG from messing with your real data. Instead,
the debug GTG will store data in ``debug_data/``.

Unit tests live in ``GTG/tests/``, and are all named ``test_foo``. When you
add a new test module, make sure it has a ``test_suite()`` method that returns
the suite of all the tests in that module. Also make sure that the new module
is imported in ``GTG.tests`` and returned from the ``test_suite()`` function
there.

For example, GTG/tests/test_newthing.py::

  import unittest

  class TestNewThing(unittest.TestCase):
      # ...

  def test_suite():
      return unittest.TestLoader().loadTestsFromName(__name__)


And GTG/tests/__init__.py::

  import unittest

  from GTG.tests import test_backends, test_newthing

  def test_suite():
      return unittest.TestSuite([
          test_backends.test_suite(),
          test_newthing.test_suite(),
          ])

When in doubt, copy from an existing test module!


Coding style
------------

In general, follow PEP 8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>.

Not all code in GTG currently follows PEP 8. If you are changing a section of
code, please update it to follow PEP 8.

You should also avoid adding any 'flakes', simple Python mistakes caught by
Pyflakes <http://www.divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodPyflakes>.

To check the cleanliness of your code, run::

  make lint

The ``make`` will fail if Pyflakes emits any warnings. You can the Pyflakes
checker separately using ``make pyflakes`` and the PEP 8 checker using ``make
pep8``. If you wish to find all PEP 8 violations in a particular file, use::

  ./scripts/pep8.py --repeat FILENAME

---------

Submitting Patches
------------------

For information about contributing code to GTG, see
<http://live.gnome.org/gtg/contributing>.


Landing Branches
----------------

  1. Get the branch.

  2. Run the tests, ``make check``.

  3. Run ``make lint``, check that the number of PEP 8 warnings is lower than
     trunk and that there are no new pyflakes warnings.

  4. Launch GTG with debugging data, just in case, ``./scripts/debug.sh``.

  5. Update ``CHANGELOG`` if it isn't already.

  6. Update ``AUTHORS`` if the patch author is not already in there.

  7. Merge the branch into trunk, then commit!
