For the list of recent contributors who made the latest release possible,
see GTG/core/info.py (the content that shows up in the GUI's About dialog).

A handwritten list here would be too long, be frequently outdated,
and would not give contributors their relative merit.
So we point you instead to:

* git shortlog -s -n  # for the all-time hall of fame
* git shortlog -s -n v0.3.1..HEAD # for the list of top contributors from the 0.3.1 release until now
* git blame the_file_you_are_interested_in
