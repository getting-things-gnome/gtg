# Installation

    pip3 install coverage

# Configuration

By default coverage will measure all code, unless it is part of the Python standard library. So we'd better create a confguration file named `.coveragerc` under root directory of GTG codebase mostly for specifying source files for measurement.

For only gtk part measurement, the configuration file could be something like below:

```
[run]
source =
    gtg
    GTG/gtk
    ../liblarch/liblarch_gtk
omit =
    run-tests
    GTG/tests/*
    ../liblarch/test*
```

For full measurement, it will be something like:

```
[run]
source =
    gtg
    GTG
    ../liblarch
omit =
    run-tests
    GTG/tests/*
    ../liblarch/test*
```

# Coverage

    coverage run gtg -d

You can add more arguments for gtg at the end of command above. For example, if you would like to use local `liblarch` for both testing, you can use:

    coverage run gtg -d -l

# Report

After running `coverage` command, it will create a file named `.coverage` to store related information. To generate the report, we need run '''coverage report''' and the report will be shown on the screen. To generate a annotated HTML listings detailing missed lines, we need to run '''coverage html''' and then we can visit `htmlcov/index.html` in the browser for a nicer presentation.

# Combine

One big problem for testing with coverage is that, coverage report will reset each time after experiments on running tests. To keep the information before, we can use another powerful feature, `combine`. Each time after generating one `.coverage` file, we can move it to another extra directory, for example, named `combine` with different file names.
When we have enough `.coverage` files, we can copy all previous `.coverage` files back to the root directory of GTG codebase. Then we need to run '''coverage combine''' to combine all `.coverage` files, after which all `.coverage` files will be converted to one sigle `.coverage` file, then you can go on with '''Report''' part work.
