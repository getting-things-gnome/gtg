# Translating GTG

Like many other open source software, GTG uses gettext to deal with translations.
Basically, [`po/gtg.pot`][gtg-pot] is a template you copy to `po/<lang>.po` and do the translation in.
You can use [GNOME Translation Editor][gtranslator], any text editor, or other applications to do the translation in.
For existing translations, you would use the old language as a basis, but it is likely not updated to the latest strings.
Because of that, you may need to update the translation files manually.

[gtg-pot]: ../../po/gtg.pot
[gtranslator]: https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gtranslator/
[gettext-plural]: https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Translating-plural-forms.html#Translating-plural-forms

# Updating the translation files

1. Follow the [readme][readme] to pull GTG and install the dependencies, especially meson and gettext.
2. Run `./launch.sh` in the repository root at least once. The folder `.local_build` should've been generated and GTG should run. Exit GTG.
3. Run `ninja -C .local_build gtg-pot gtg-update-po` to update the translation files.

[readme]: ../../README.md

After that, you can then use the updated translation files and translate the missing strings.

# Testing the changes

Testing the changes is useful since you can then see your translation in action and see potentially mistranslation due to missing context.

[Setup the environment][readme] and then simply run `LC_ALL=<lang>.UTF-8 LANGUAGE=<lang>.UTF-8 ./launch.sh` in the repository root to compile the translations and run GTG with the `<lang>` language.
For example, `LC_ALL=de_DE.UTF-8 LANGUAGE=de_DE.UTF-8 ./launch.sh` would run GTG with the German translation.
You don't need the `LC_ALL=<lang>.UTF-8 LANGUAGE=<lang>.UTF-8` part if you run the system in the destination language anyway.
You can use the `C` language to run without any translations: `LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 LANGUAGE=C.UTF-8 ./launch.sh`

# Submitting

Done translating and it looks good?
Then consider sending the correct `.po`-file to the project.

## Using git (with a pull/merge request)

Update the repository to get the newest changes:

    git fetch --all

Create a new branch (assumes that origin is the upstream repository, which is the default if you clone the upstream repository):

    git switch -c my-translation-branch origin/master
    # If git switch isn't available, use:
    git branch my-translation-branch origin/master
    git checkout my-translation-branch

Add and commit the translation file:

    git add po/<lang>.po
    git commit -m "Updated translation for <lang>"

Fork the upstream repository if you haven't.
You then need to add the repository to git:

    git remote add fork https://clone-url-of-your-forked-repo

Then push to your forked repo:

    git push fork my-translation-branch

Then finally you can create a pull/merge request via the web interface.

You may want to reset the not modified translation files to prevent git showing you a lot of uncommited files that could interfere when switching branches.
Make sure to this AFTER COMMITING YOUR CHANGES!

    git checkout -- po # drop uncommited translation changes

# Potential errors

* Not removing the `#, fuzzy` line/part, which causes the translation not to apply
* During launching, it might complain about certain files not being found in [`po/POTFILES.in`][POTFILES.IN].
  It is safe to remove the lines from that file and re-run until it works.
  It would be useful to comment about that if you're submitting your translation, just in case.

[POTFILES.IN]: ../../po/POTFILES.in
