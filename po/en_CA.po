"Welcome to Getting Things GNOME!, your new task manager! In Getting Things "
"GNOME! (GTG), everything is a task. From building a bridge over the Pacific "
"Ocean to changing a light bulb or organizing a party!\n"
"\n"
"If you are new to GTG, please take the time to read this, as it will provide "
"you useful information about how to use GTG to organize your everyday life.\n"
"\n"
"Creating and editing tasks:\n"
"\n"
"Using GTG is easy: you organize what you have to do by creating new tasks. "
"To do this, simply press the &quot;New Task&quot; button, edit the task by "
"describing it, set some parameters, and that's it! Once a task done, you can "
"close it by pressing the &quot;Mark As Done&quot; button.\n"
"\n"
"In GTG, a task is automatically saved while you are editing it. No need to "
"press any &quot;Save&quot; button! Try it: add some text to this task, close "
"the window, and reopen it: your changes are still there!\n"
"\n"
"About subtasks:\n"
"\n"
"In life, you often get more things done by refining them in smaller, more "
"operational tasks. GTG helps to do just this by defining  "
"&quot;subtasks&quot;. In GTG, those subtasks are considered as prerequisites "
"that must be completed before being able to close their parent task.\n"
"\n"
"Therefore, in GTG, a task might host one or several subtasks. Those appear "
"as links in the task description, just like the link below. To open and edit "
"a subtask, simply click on its link! Try it yourself: open the following "
"subtask:\n"
"<subtask>1@1</subtask>\n"
"\n"
"Closing a task:\n"
"\n"
"In GTG, once you are done with a task, you can close it by pushing either "
"the &quot;Mark as Done&quot; or the &quot;Dismiss&quot; button. Use the "
"first one if the task is done, and the latter if you want to close it "
"because it is not relevant anymore. Want to try it? Try to close the subtask "
"above for instance!\n"
"\n"
"When you close a task, you will notice that all its subtasks will be "
"automatically closed too! Indeed, GTG considers that if you have completed a "
"given task, then you don't need to do its subtasks anymore (they were "
"prerequisites, after all).\n"
"\n"
"Note that the tasks that you have marked as done or dismissed are listed in "
"the &quot;Closed Tasks Pane&quot; which is hidden by default, but you can "
"easily show it using the View menu.\n"
"\n"
"Learn more about GTG:\n"
"\n"
"If you are interested in knowing more about GTG's other features, you will "
"find more information here:\n"
"<subtask>2@1</subtask>\n"
"<subtask>3@1</subtask>\n"
"<subtask>4@1</subtask>\n"

"\n"
"You can also browse GTG documentation by pressing F1 or opening it using the "
"Help menu.\n"
"\n"
"We sincerely hope you will enjoy using GTG, and thank you for trying it out! "
