====== Getting Things GNOME! ======

Getting Things GNOME! (GTG) is a personal tasks and TODO list items organizer
for the GNOME desktop environment inspired by the Getting Things Done (GTD)
methodology. GTG is designed with flexibility, adaptability, and ease of use
in mind so it can be used as more than just GTD software.

GTG is intended to help you track everything you need to do and need to know,
from small tasks to large projects.

===== Dependencies =====

GTG depends on the following packages:

 * Python, version 2.6 or above
 * PyGTK
 * python-support
 * python-configobj
 * python-xdg
 * python-liblarch 
 * python-dbus
 * yelp (to read GTG documentation)
 * python-suds (dependency of MantisBT backend)
 * python-evolution (dependency of Evolution backend)

To generate the API documentation, you'll also need to install 'pydoctor'.

Please refer to your system documentation for information on how to install
these modules if they're not currently available.

To install the all the required packages providing the basic features on
Debian-based systems, execute the following command:
    $ sudo apt-get install python-support python-gtk2 python-gnome2 \
         python-glade2 python-xdg python-configobj python-liblarch yelp

To enable API documentation generation, execute this command:
    $ sudo apt-get install python-pydoctor

For evolution backend, you need python-evolution by command:
    $ sudo apt-get install python-evolution

For MantisBT backend, you need python-suds by command:
    $ sudo apt-get install python-suds

===== Installing and Running =====

To install GTG, either unpack the tarball:

    $ tar xzvf gtg.tar.gz

or check out our bazaar branch for a development version (we try to keep those
unbroken and ready for production use):

    $ bzr branch lp:gtg

To run GTG, either execute it directly from the source folder:

    $ cd gtg/
    $ ./gtg

or install it system-wide (must install as root to install system-wide):

    $ cd gtg
    $ sudo python setup.py install # must be root to install system-wide
    $ gtg

Please note you have to pass --install-layout=deb option to setup.py script
to correctly install GTG on recent Ubuntu versions (9.04 "Jaunty" or later):

    $ sudo python setup.py install --install-layout=deb

==== How To Use GTG? ====

Please refer to our documentation to get a thorough explanation on how GTG
works.

To do this, you will need the yelp help viewer. On Debian-based systems, you
can install yelp by executing this command:

    $ sudo apt-get install yelp

You can then view the documentation either by accessing it through GTG (press
F1 or use the help menu), or by using the command line using the following
command:

    $ yelp help:gtg

If you want to read the documentation directly from the source code, use
this command (from the source root dir):

    $ yelp doc/userdoc/C/index.page

==== Using GTG from the command line ====

GTG provides two command line tools that allows to interact with GTG:

 * gtcli
 * gtg_new_task

gtcli provides many options to display, list or edit tasks. gtg_new_task
provides a GTG command line client that allows to easily add tasks.

If you want to know more about how to use these tools, please refer to the
tools man page.

If you have installed gtg, you can access those by executing:

    $ man gtcli
    $ man gtg_new_task
