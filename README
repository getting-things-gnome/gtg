====== Getting Things GNOME! ======

Getting Things GNOME! (GTG) is a personal organizer for the GNOME desktop
environment inspired by the Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology. GTG is
designed with flexibility, adaptability, and ease of use in mind so it can be
used as more than just GTD software.

GTG is intended to help you track everything you need to do and need to know,
from small tasks to large projects.

===== Dependencies =====

GTG depends on the following packages:
 * Python, version 2.6 or above
 * PyGTK
 * python-configobj
 * python-xdg
 * python-liblarch 
 * python-liblarch-gtk

To generate the API documentation, you'll also need to install 'pydoctor'.

Please refer to your system documentation for information on how to install
these modules if they're not currently available.

To install these packages on Debian-based systems, execute the following
command:
    $ sudo apt-get install install python-gtk2 python-gnome2 python-glade2 \
         python-xdg python-configobj python-pydoctor

Note that the python-pydoctor package is broken in karmic.

===== Installing and Running =====

To install GTG, either unpack the tarball:

    $ tar xzvf gtg.tar.gz

or check out our bazaar branch for a development version (we try to keep those
unbroken and ready for production use):

    $ bzr branch lp:gtg

To run GTG, either execute it directly from the source folder:

    $ cd gtg/
    $ ./gtg

or install it system-wide (must install as root to install system-wide):

    $ cd gtg
    $ sudo python setup.py install # must be root to install system-wide
    $ gtg

Please note you have to pass --install-layout=deb option to setup.py script
to correctly install GTG on recent Ubuntu versions (9.04 "Jaunty" or later):

    $ sudo python setup.py install --install-layout=deb

==== Usage ====

When writing a task, keep in mind that:
 1) A line beginning with "-" will automatically create a subtask on that line
 2) A word beginning with "@" is a tag

===== Quick add =====

In the quickadd line you can use "attribute:argument" with any title.
Valid attributes are: "tags", "defer", "due"
E.g.:
 "due:friday task description"
 "more work due:today"
 "due:tomorrow foo work"
 "my bar task tags:@foo"
