# "Can I have a pony? I want it now!"

Due to limited resources (time and people/energy), and because GTG is already a mature and useful application, non-trivial feature requests are unlikely to be implemented unless one of these two conditions are met:

* we're personally excited enough about the feature for our own use *and* can personally allocate time and energy to implement it ourselves (in which case it may be targetted to a particular milestone and "assigned" to the individual actively working on it), or...
* you can provide a patch. See also the "How do I get started?" section further below for links to issues you can work on.

If it's not targetted to a milestone, and it has the "patch-or-wont-happen" label, don't "expect" it to happen in any particular timeframe, unless someone steps forward to contribute the code for that feature.

# Ways you can help

We are always looking for new people to help fix bugs (if any), improve the quality of the code, and refine the UI and performance. Your contributions make all the difference. We can't implement every feature requested by ourselves, or we would never be able to make releases in a timely manner. This is also why we have "low-hanging fruit" issues available for newcomers to tackle. So please contribute patches for the issues you care the most about.

Not a programmer but want to contribute in other ways? There's a lot to do. We also welcome help in these areas:

* Public communications (helping research & write release notes, announcements and status updates, sharing those with journalists or on social media and public forums, etc.)
* Documentation (improving the user manual or contributors' documentation, maintaining the wiki contents)
* Testing and troubleshooting, researching & analyzing potential technical solutions
* Helping maintain our official Flatpak packages, packaging for various Linux distributions (and keeping those packages up to date!)
* Translating & localizing the app and its user manual
* Convincing your programmer friends to send us patches for your favorite issues ;)

# "Cool! How do I get started?"

1. If you haven't already, read through the [README.md](README.md) file to get your development version of GTG up and running.
2. Check out our contributors documentation in the docs/contributors/ subfolder.
3. See what needs to be done and roll up your sleeves! In our issue tracker, we use two labels in particular to identify areas where you are encouraged to contribute a patch/branch:
  * Issues tagged "[low-hanging-fruit](https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/labels/low-hanging-fruit)" are issues that are meant for people who are either beginner programmers or who need some practice to get accustomed to the GTG codebase. They are "easy picks" suitable for new contributors to tackle.
  * Issues tagged "[patch-or-wont-happen](https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/labels/patch-or-wont-happen)" are features that have been requested and that the core GTG maintainers would like, but lack time/energy, and they are harder than "low-hanging-fruit". These issues require you to step up and contribute a patch or they "will not happen" on their own.
  * If your issue/work item is not already reported, you can file a new one to propose your idea and/or seek help/advice in implementing it.
